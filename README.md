This program uses a algorithm such that it links two movie stars and finds thier shortest relation. 
For Example : 
```Name: Emma Watson
Name: Jennifer Lawrence
3 relations away.
1: Emma Watson and Brendan Gleeson starred in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
2: Brendan Gleeson and Michael Fassbender starred in Trespass Against Us
3: Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence starred in X-Men: First Class```

In this way the program will find the shortest link between two movie stars.
